## (0) Project Name and Team Slack Handles
（0）.AdventureGo
（0）.https://filecoinproject.slack.com/team/UPC9BT2BG
*Please tell us your project's name and the Filecoin Slack handles for your teammates.*

## (1) Brief Project Description
Offering Filecoin based data, such as mining rankings, blockchain data query, visual chart and other data services.
（1）Providing Filecoin based data, such as mining rankings, blockchain data query, visual chart and other data services.
*Add your project's description here.*

## (2) Link to Project UI
（2）https://www.1475ipfs.com/blockBrowser
*Please include a link to your project application or UI. It does not need to be super polished or completely functional. We will be reviewing this link periodically to verify that your project is eligible for final rewards.*

## (3) What does your application/UI do?
（3）Quering Filecoin network data from time to time
*Give us a brief description of what your application/UI does and how users are intended to interact with it.*

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?
sql text.
（4）No
*You can reference the [list of curated datasets in this repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md). If you'd like to use a dataset that is not on that list, please nominate your chosen dataset by updating the curated datasets table in this PR. If nominating a dataset, do you own or have exclusive rights to the data you plan to use?*

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.
（5）sql text
     no
     yes
     no
*What sorts of data will you collect? Do you own or have exclusive rights to the data you plan to use? Is the data license available online? Does the data contain any sensitive or illegal information?*

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
（6）300TiB
*Give us as realistic an estimate as you possibly can at this stage. We understand it's impossible to have perfect information before really starting your project!*

## (7) How are you structuring the data?
（7）Structured.
*Is this structured or unstructured data? What data formats, schemas, etc. does this dataset follow?*

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?
（8）
1% stock data +99% data to be developed
8mb
sql
*How will you prepare this data for ingestion into Filecoin? What size storage deals will you be making? If this is a tabular dataset or directory structure, how will you maintain indices into the data so you can retrieve specific data as needed for your application? This is currently one of the most important steps to being successful with data storage on Filecoin. Feel free to ask for help and/or look at docs for recommendations!*

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?
（9）lotus.

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?
（10）Setting a limit by time limit and client limit. When either limit is reached a retrieve would start.
*Share some more information about the data retrieval plans for your application? How often does the data need to be retrieved? What is the size of each individual read? Do you need to retrieve from Filecoin (colder storage) or from an intermediate caching layer, like IPFS? How will your application/UI retrieve the necessary data and expose it/interact with it in the UI?*

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?
（11）Enterprise users with needs for data storage
*Who do you anticipate will use your project/dataset?*

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?
（12）A few users for now. Providing free storage space.
*Yes/no. Also, please tell us a little bit about your future plans for user acquisition.*

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?
（13）Sealing speed is not enough. The download speed is slow after retrieving the data.

Optimizing code, upgrading sealing speed, improving the speed of data download
*We'd love to know what you're most worried about so we can help as much as possible. Let us know what you anticipate to be the biggest challenges with this project!*
