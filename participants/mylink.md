Submission ID: 682082160,
Project Name: My Link,
Slack: my-linkhq.slack.com , channel: #publishing-a-branded-mobile-page-for-ipfs-storage

## (1) Brief Project Description
*Add your project's description here.*

MyLink is a tool and service that makes it easier and faster to create the mobile page you want.
This service stores information on the IPFS distributed server, which creates faster, higher quality information and a service with no loss of stored files.
MyLink is an IPFS-based service, and unlike traditional services, information does not exist only on the central server, making it safer and faster because it is stored on multiple nodes in the region close to you.

## (2) Link to Project UI

*Please include a link to your project application or UI. It does not need to be super polished or completely functional. We will be reviewing this link periodically to verify that your project is eligible for final rewards.*

## (3) What does your application/UI do?

*Give us a brief description of what your application/UI does and how users are intended to interact with it.*

Problems When Writing Web Pages

Many page-writing tools on the market may be easy tools, but they are still difficult to use for non-professionals or for those who are new to them.

To solve this problem, it's probably an additional cost and it's hard to keep it going because someone has to make changes to address, other information, photos and videos. In addition, these services are limited by storage constraints, making it difficult to store high-quality photos and videos.

To solve many of these problems, MyLink provides a very simple method and UI.
We use IPFS-based storage and with Alliance Minor support, we can archive and retrieve higher levels of content faster.

Purpose of MyLink's Use

1. Pages for personal promotion
2. Pages made for store and other business advertising purposes
3. Pages by category of images and movies suitable for individual classification purposes
4. This is a simple page for corporate information delivery.

MyLink's Advantage

1. After downloading MyLink's Editor app, you can create your own page by connecting or recalling photos on your smartphone or directly camera-generated images.
2. It's so easy and time-consuming that it's good to use to promote your store's advertising or create your own links.
3. Each page also fits the purpose of saving and classifying individual files. Each information is stored on an IPFS distributed server, and even if one server disappears on a node, there is little risk of loss due to the information stored on the other.
4. This file is stored distributed across servers that use the IPFS protocol, so there is little risk of loss and fast loading.
5. The pages you create are easy to link links to social media, web pages, etc.
6. Also, each page's image or text can be linked to link your SNS and other information. This allows you to create richer pages.

MyLink Features

1. Edit Features: Save all data to the app itself
2. Publication Features: All information is uploaded to storage on IPFS
3. Archive Functions: Storage and Recalling Edited Data on Storage on IPFS

How to Use My Link

1. Download MyLink Editor first.
2. Create a page using the Start Right button.
3. Use SNS accounts such as Google, Facebook, etc. or log in to MyLink Editor via your email.
4. Take pictures or videos with the camera function of your smartphone.
5. Alternatively, import and upload images and images already stored.
6. In the case of invalid files, deletion and addition are easy.
7. Create a page and link through the Open Page button.

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

*You can reference the [list of curated datasets in this repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md). If you'd like to use a dataset that is not on that list, please nominate your chosen dataset by updating the curated datasets table in this PR. If nominating a dataset, do you own or have exclusive rights to the data you plan to use?*

Users own their page (data) that they make.


## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

*What sorts of data will you collect? Do you own or have exclusive rights to the data you plan to use? Is the data license available online? Does the data contain any sensitive or illegal information?*

Users own their page (data) that they make. We provide only the tool to make their mobile page which will be stored in IPFS to spread out and others will open the link and see and use it for information.

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

*Give us as realistic an estimate as you possibly can at this stage. We understand it's impossible to have perfect information before really starting your project!*

It depends on users. If this project be successfully launched, more than 100TiB data will be stored. Our mylink can be downloaded from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

*Is this structured or unstructured data? What data formats, schemas, etc. does this dataset follow?*

Image, Text, Movie will be on the pages and they are stored onto IPFS nodes.

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

*How will you prepare this data for ingestion into Filecoin? What size storage deals will you be making? If this is a tabular dataset or directory structure, how will you maintain indices into the data so you can retrieve specific data as needed for your application? This is currently one of the most important steps to being successful with data storage on Filecoin. Feel free to ask for help and/or look at docs for recommendations!*

My Link is a page authoring service that simply uses externally created information as a means of publicity for individuals and businesses.
All of this information is created by the app, but the created page information is stored in the ipfs node and delivered as a link. When others click on this link, the information in the ipfs node is represented. We use File Coin to use many services. IPFS is understood as a much superior storage concept compared to traditional cloud services. In addition, our My Link service is expected to be easily expanded to a global service.


## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

*Either: Powergate, Hosted Powergate, Textile Hub/Buckets, lotus, or some other solution. Tell us what you're planning to use and how.*

We are going to use Powergate to store images and video information produced through MYLINK.

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

*Share some more information about the data retrieval plans for your application? How often does the data need to be retrieved? What is the size of each individual read? Do you need to retrieve from Filecoin (colder storage) or from an intermediate caching layer, like IPFS? How will your application/UI retrieve the necessary data and expose it/interact with it in the UI?*

Every page that an individual makes easily and quickly creates a link automatically, and if you pass it on to someone outside for a variety of purposes, the viewer will click on the link to retrieve the data on the ipfs.

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

*Who do you anticipate will use your project/dataset?*

Individuals and corporations.
I think the main target is the operators of the store or freelancers who need personal promotion.


## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

*Yes/no. Also, please tell us a little bit about your future plans for user acquisition.*

The start of the full-fledged business is planned in two months. Currently, we are developing to increase the degree of completion. In the meantime, a sample page will be created and stored on the IPF node.
In addition, we are planning user racing. Through this, a lot of information will be stored on IPFS, and many examples of services will come out.

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

*We'd love to know what you're most worried about so we can help as much as possible. Let us know what you anticipate to be the biggest challenges with this project!*

Global marketing support is required as the number of users needs to be increased.
