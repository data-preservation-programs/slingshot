## (0) Project Name and Team Slack Handles

- Project Name : Fildown
- Slack Handles : lulu

## (1) Brief Project Description

We want to provide commonly used, free or used software for users to download through the app. Because now a lot of downloaded software will be bundled with a variety of software or advertising. We want to provide advertising free, high quality interface and faster download speed.


## (2) Link to Project UI

## (3) What does your application/UI do?

Our application is mainly search based, in the future when you can download more software, provide classification function.


## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

No using curated dataset.

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

We provide the data from the official download of various software official platforms

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

We will store these dataset about 6TiB ~ 10TiB during the slingshot competition.

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

We use Mysql to structure these datasets

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

Not yet

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

We use Powergate to interact with Filecoin client(Lotus) and IPFS.

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

We will store the data in my local machine, so firstly I will retrieval the data from the local storage, if the file is destroyed, we will try to get it from IPFS (if can). Finally, we will send a retrieval deal to the miner of Filecoin network(this process maybe take a long time).

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

For the software needs of users can use our application, regardless of their operating system is windows, MacOS and so on.


## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

No, for now, I juest start develop it, I will storage some different kinds of software.
For a long-term considering, I will develop download function for the storage data to help users more conveniently use it.
 
## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

- The time and cost is big challenge for me, we need more time to download data and send it to miners.
- I need more time to develop more functions.
- I need some testFil to send data to miners, and some stable miners to accept my data order, many miners in that list do not accept my deal.
