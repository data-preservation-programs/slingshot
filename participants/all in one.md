## (0) Registration Submission, Project Name, and Team Slack Handles
Our project name: all in one
Team slack handle: f2765 (docker-f2765@hotmail.com)

## (1) Brief Project Description
The project named All-In-One, the same name with some docker-hub devices, our team are coming from China with 6 core team members.

The vision of our team is to deploy our valuable docker images in IPFS networking, and hope the decentralized IPFS system/networking could carry our all-in-one docker image resources with low-cost but high-performance experience,  and interact with our widely spreading client more effecively.

## (2) Link to Project UI
The site is now in upgrading by OM team, will be finished and accessible on 24 Nov. 2020.

## (3) What does your application/UI do?
Providing the following application functionalities for our widely spreading subscribers:
1. Docker images, which integrated with main stream infrastructure modules within it to avoiding complexities, re-build, maintenance consumption for our subscribers.
2. Authorized subsceribers can also submit, upload, and share their valuable docker images to IPFS via our portal.
2. IPFS storage interacts between FilCoin networking and clients.

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?
Category: Docker Images

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.
No, we are NOT going to use other resources.

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
The total data we are going to store is 10T, the final figure we actualy stored will be updated in our final materials submission.

## (7) How are you structuring the data?
The access method of our unstructured Objective Data (pure rebuilt docker images) will be stored in RMDB, clients can access the objective data according to the meta structure pre-defined in our RMDB with its unique hash identifer value. 

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?
Administrator and users upload pictures via our system portal, All-In-One system will record, transfer and transform the user data to IPFS system according to several dimentions of user accessing identifiers;
On the vice way, user can also access the target data according to the object data information indexed on the portal and its meta data structure stored in the RMDB databases.

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?
Lotus and Ipfs

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?
User can explore, search, upload, share their expected docker image data on the web portal, then the data indexes will target the objective data which been stored on IPFS networking, to response the access target path.

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?
1. Docker users
2. Softeware and application fans

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?
we have a certain group of users already, and the marketing development plan will be coming soon.

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?
how could we continous improved abilities and effectiveness to develop our various applications and extensions over the IPFS technologies.
