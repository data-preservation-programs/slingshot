- Project Name: tinyffs
- Filecoin slack handle: clos

(1) Brief Project Description

tinyffs is a simple file explorer where you and your friends are able to collectively explore and share files through a distributed network. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

(2) Link to Project UI

(3) What does your application/UI do?

Currently browse through .mp3 audio files in a directory like fascion. But plan to develop tinyffs further to support uploading. And if there is still time in slingshot, possibly turn into 3DFS to support 3D file formats and display 3D models.  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ ✧ﾟ･: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)

(4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

The eligible Free Music Archive .mp3 files

(5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data 
May dabble with free/open source models from Sketchfab ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ )

(6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

4GB - 800GB

(7) How are you structuring the data?

Displaying .mp3 files grouped in folders by artist names 

(8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

Retrieve metadata from within .mp3 files to create a json like data file that tracks the the directory and other info (ie. artist name, song name, etc...)

(9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?
Textile Hub/Buckets for hosting and submission to filecoin data storage, possibly js-textile for file uploading

(10) How will you retrieve the data?

Navigate to desired file and double click to open/play chosen audio file

(11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

Artists…..       ⚆ _ ⚆          〆(・∀・＠)

(12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

No. But, as briefly touched on above tinyffs could grow to support/display 3D files where I imagine a place to share and collaborate on Animation / AR/VR projects :D

(13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

As a solo noob developer taking on this very unique slingshot race I anticipate managing multiple Buckets to support greater file storage to be challenging. I’m also slightly worried about long sealing times to archive on the miner side.
