*Is this structured or unstructured data? What data formats, schemas, etc. does this dataset follow?*

Unstructured


## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

*How will you prepare this data for ingestion into Filecoin? What size storage deals will you be making? If this is a tabular dataset or directory structure, how will you maintain indices into the data so you can retrieve specific data as needed for your application? This is currently one of the most important steps to being successful with data storage on Filecoin. Feel free to ask for help and/or look at docs for recommendations!*

10% stock data +90% data to be developed + revenue sharing

128mb

sql map for data and deal


## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

*Either:*
lotus

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

*Share some more information about the data retrieval plans for your application? How often does the data need to be retrieved? What is the size of each individual read? Do you need to retrieve from Filecoin (colder storage) or from an intermediate caching layer, like IPFS? How will your application/UI retrieve the necessary data and expose it/interact with it in the UI?*

To finish any retrieving come from client when get deal.


## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

*Who do you anticipate will use your project/dataset?*

To be the “amazon cloud” of the Filecoin network.
