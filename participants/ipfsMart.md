(1) Brief Project Description.  
AI is smartening up our lives from almost all aspects, including living facilities, routine services, production processes and business models. AI platforms provide data scientists with end-to-end solutions for them to develop AI applications from ideation to production and deployment. This project (**ipfsMart**) aims at empowering such AI platforms one step ahead by making the best use of Filecoin and IPFS' unique features. As a result, the following would be achieved. First, an AI application could be developed by a community with multiple roles. Second, people would be more willing to contribute and annotate data sources. Third, any intermediate data, results and models are stored and maintained by a version management system. Fourth, each final AI model/application would be replicated multiple copies and deployed in multiple nodes for continuously access services.

(3) What does your application/UI do?   
**ipfsMart** provides all essentials for users to develop AI applications as a routine AI platform, and it further provides the following activities.  
First, a data scientist can make an application development task as an open project, so anyone can contribute to this task by providing data and making annotations.  
Second, AI models could be trained based on the whole set or a subset of the provided data. Any individual's any contribution (i.e., data provision and annotation) would be linked to the corresponding model and be quantified as a portion of options.  
Third, because the training process continuously provides intermediate models, **ipfsMart** takes advantage of the sufficient storage space of IPFS to store all all intermediate models for potential use instead of dropping them off as the routine operation.  
Fourth, once a final model/application is obtained after sufficient training and verification, **ipfsMart** deploys it onto different IPFS nodes rather than deploy it onto a single machine as the routine operation. As a result, when multiple customers access to the AI model/application synchronously, **ipfsMart** can allocate the models of different nodes to deal with different customer's access requirements.  
Finally, each access to the model could generate a certain quantity of profit, and the profit would be given to all contributors (i.e., data scientist, dat provider and data annotator) according to the potions they hold.  
 
(4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?   
We do not use curated datasets.

(5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.   
We only provide a platform for carrying out the AI projects. We do not own the data, and the data rights belong to our users.    

(6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?   
We wish to contribute to 0.5-1T quantity of data.   

(7) How are you structuring the data?   
Most of these data is unstructured, like videos and images.   

(8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?   
We transfer user's data, intermediate models and final models/applications to the IPFS network and assign a unique identifier for each piece of data.   

(9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?   
lotus

(10) How will you retrieve the data?   
The retrieve frequency is determined by the popularity of different AI applications. Once a user request the access to a certain application, **ipfsMart** retrieve the data from ipfs or filecoin network then run the model. Only the result will be given to users.   

(11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?   
data scientist/engineers, data providers.  

(12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?   
plan to acquire users soon.  

(13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?   
we are not sure if the data retrieve speed is fast enough for providing smooth services.
