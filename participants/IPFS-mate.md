## (0) Registration Submission, Project Name, and Team Slack Handles
Project name: FilCoin-Mate
Team slack handle: hugh-p2 (hugh_st_p2@hotmail.com)

## (1) Brief Project Description
The abbrevation FilCoin-Mate stands for the mate of FilCoin; our team, which been formed with 5 blockchain fans mainly from China, are aiming to explore the FilCoin applications development with FilCoin storage technologies.

The Project Application Portal is in implementation process, will be driving out on 23 Nov. 2020.

## (3) What does your application/UI do?
We developed the system in order to provide an Internet/BlockChain based OpenSource sharing, redistributing platform for subscribers, the functionalities including:
1. User explore, select, download their expected application source code packages;
2. User re-code or sharing their favorite packages to their friends (with the objective harsh code at first stage);

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?
Github/Gitee

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.
No, we will NOT use other dataset.

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
10T

## (7) How are you structuring the data?
The accessing meta structures of objective data will be indexed on our RMDB database, user can explore, search, store, and retrieve the target data source with the RMDB index structures.

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?
According to user behaviours, our system create, maintain the objective data with compress tar format, and index the objective data with the meta structure in our RMDB database.

The stored data will be package and compress in starndard .tar, .tar.gz format, therefore, subscribers who retrieved the data will need to extract by following ways:
1. extension name with .tar:
   c:\tar xvf file_name.tar
2. extension name with .tar.gz:
   c:\tar zxvf file_name.tar
3. extension name with .4_digital:
   c:\cat file_name.ext_a.* >  file_name.ext_a 
   c:\tar zxvf file_name.ext_a

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?
Lotus

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?
Users retrieve and store their target data from FilCoin system via the responding hash code (cid based) from our system portal.

The stored data will be package and compress in starndard .tar, .tar.gz format, therefore, subscribers who retrieved the data will need to extract by following ways:
1. extension name with .tar:
   c:\tar xvf file_name.tar
2. extension name with .tar.gz:
   c:\tar zxvf file_name.tar
3. extension name with .4_digital:
   c:\cat file_name.ext_a.* >  file_name.ext_a 
   c:\tar zxvf file_name.ext_a

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?
1. Software developers.
2. IT staffs.
3. Student.

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?
Yes, we've already have a small group of users.

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?
FilCoin system could provide more effective and flex API/SDK to facilite our fast growing developing demands.
