## (0) Project Name and Team Slack Handles

Project Name:FGDC (The Filecoin Genomics Data Center)  
Slack:ipfsauth  
MemberId:U01424WLP4Y  

## (1) Brief Project Description

*The Filecoin Genomics Data Center (FGDC) is an open and free data center for storing genes, using blockchain to provide a data center that will never be lost for all mankind. We hope to reduce the cost of a single gene reading to the limit, which means that everyone has a greater possibility of obtaining their own genetic data, and the relationship between genetic data and individuals will be greater. At the same time, in the future, we hope to reduce the cost of genetic data analysis to the limit, so that everyone can freely use genetic analysis technology.*

## (2) Link to Project UI

*demo: https://fgdc.minerscan.io/#*


## (3) What does your application/UI do?

*The website can check the genetic data according to the input, the retrieval procedure is completed in the background, and the UI is only responsible for inputting and displaying the retrieval results.*

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

*Various*

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

*We will not collect any data, and store it in the Filecoin network. In the IPFS network, there is no complete data in our application, and the data uploaded to the IPFS network will be reviewed by our staff.*

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

*We plan to upload at least 100T of genetic data from the genetic database to filecoin storage, such as uploading the current COVID-19 genetic database to filecoin.*

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

*We plan to store the data completely on filecoin storageï¼Œbut some metadata data will be stored in a database, such as mysql.*

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

*If there is a problem during the integration process, we need your help.*

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

*Powergate, mysql or elanticsearch to speed up search*

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

*Retrieve cool data from filecoin storage and retrieve metadata from database*

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

*Individual users and academic users*

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

*There are no users yet, but we hope to store genetic data on the blockchain to attract more academic users*

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

*Retrieval speed, whether retrieval will affect windowpost.*
