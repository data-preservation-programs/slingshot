## (1) Brief Project Description

A decentralized social network framework using IPFS, Filecoin and Ethereum. This submission showcases how the AKASHA framework can be used to build a decentralized social network - in this case for the Ethereum community.

## (2) Link to Project UI

https://ethereum-world.netlify.app/

## (3) What does your application/UI do?

User profile management, posting and reading content that uses ethereum smart contracts and stores data on ipfs

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

We're not using a curated dataset, we will archive data from beta.akasha.world which is already available on ipfs. Besides this we will also store content from https://lpcc.web.cern.ch/lhc-data-publications

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

N/A

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

Between 10-50 Gb of data.

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

We are using W3C schemas for our data and ipld-dag-cbor.

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

The data is stored as a textile bucket, so it will have a folder structure.

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

We run our own lotus node, powergate and textile hub.

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

we use hot storage (IPFS) with our buckets so we will rely on Filecoin to retrieve data that is not available through the IPFS network.

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

Mainly the Ethereum community at first - with the mention that it would be possible to build a social network for the Filecoin community as well using the AKASHA framework.

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

We already have users from beta.akasha.world, plus about 40K signups on the AKASHA mailing list and another 1245 signups for the ethereum.world early access.

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

Self sustainability, moderation and UX.
