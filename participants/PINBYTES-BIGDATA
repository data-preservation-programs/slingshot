## (0) Registration Submission, Project Name, and Team Slack Handles
*Please provide the Submission ID from your [Slingshot registration confirmation] (https://slingshot.filecoin.io/register-now). Also, confirm your project's name and the Filecoin Slack handles for your teammates.* 
Project Name : PINBYTES-BIGDATA
Slack : PINBYTES-BIGDATA

## (1) Brief Project Description
*Add your project's description here.*
PINBYTES-BIGDATA is a data platform managing Big Data, and to develop solutions for AI, ML and IoT.
Our Big Data project is aimed to develop data science technology that uses existing data in computers to predict future behavior, results, and trends. 
With our Big Data resource, we are planning to develop and provide advanced solutions through our server network using IPFS. 
We plan to provide educational benefits to global students and students from developing and underdeveloped countries. At the same time, our data & solutions based on IPFS would help our customers run their businesses in a better efficient way, including finance, marketing and logistics. And further it would support industrial innovation through such areas as learning and testing in bio-medical research, and progressive solutions in pretreatment, and model development and distribution in smart factories.

## (2) Link to Project UI
*Please include a link to your project application or UI. It does not need to be super polished or completely functional. We will be reviewing this link periodically to verify that your project is eligible for final rewards.*

Link to our project UI is : (IP?)
PINBYTES.COM/BIGDATA

## (3) What does your application/UI do?
*Give us a brief description of what your application/UI does and how users are intended to interact with it.*
The creators upload their contents, shares and communicate with the viewers. 

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?
*You can reference the [list of curated datasets in this repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md). If you'd like to use a dataset that is not on that list, please nominate your chosen dataset by updating the curated datasets table in this PR. If nominating a dataset, do you own or have exclusive rights to the data you plan to use?*

National Cancer Institute	
Cancer data for analysis	18.46 TB 	JSON	https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository
And various open research data sets

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.
*What sorts of data will you collect? Do you own or have exclusive rights to the data you plan to use? Is the data license available online? Does the data contain any sensitive or illegal information?*
Would mostly use various open research data sets using JASON API

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
*Give us as realistic an estimate as you possibly can at this stage. We understand it's impossible to have perfect information before really starting your project!*
Around 1PB or more, as much as we can.

## (7) How are you structuring the data?
*Is this structured or unstructured data? What data formats, schemas, etc. does this dataset follow?*
Would mostly use various open research data sets using JASON API

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?
*How will you prepare this data for ingestion into Filecoin? What size storage deals will you be making? If this is a tabular dataset or directory structure, how will you maintain indices into the data so you can retrieve specific data as needed for your application? This is currently one of the most important steps to being successful with data storage on Filecoin. Feel free to ask for help and/or look at docs for recommendations!*
We would love to get some recommendations

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?
*Either: Powergate, Hosted Powergate, Textile Hub/Buckets, lotus, or some other solution. Tell us what you're planning to use and how.*
*Either: Powergate/JSON

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?
*Share some more information about the data retrieval plans for your application? How often does the data need to be retrieved? What is the size of each individual read? Do you need to retrieve from Filecoin (colder storage) or from an intermediate caching layer, like IPFS? How will your application/UI retrieve the necessary data and expose it/interact with it in the UI?*
Once our data would be stored by ourselves or when itâ€™s retrieved from the Filecoin and the storage transaction has been successfully sealed, deal and stored in IPFS, the data would be distributed smoothly to our users.

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?
*Who do you anticipate will use your project/dataset?*
Students, Researchers, Corporations and Ourselves

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?
*Yes/no. Also, please tell us a little bit about your future plans for user acquisition.*
We are planning to discover and store a lot of research data, and cooperate with reserchers, schools, etc.

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?
*We'd love to know what you're most worried about so we can help as much as possible. Let us know what you anticipate to be the biggest challenges with this project!*
We are still studying IPFS to cooperate well in development of platforms further more for our CDN business.
