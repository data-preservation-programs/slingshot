## (1) Brief Project Description

Since 2018 Livetree has built up a range of video solutions that can be operated via our own cloud. We are seeking to decentralise the solution, through the migration of our storage of video files and related meta-data using FileCoin.io. At a later stage we will be looking to replace our CDN networks with Filecoin and rollout our own media-object video protocol which encompasses DRM and transcoding services.
