## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
10TiB

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

schemas

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

There are no preparaions, the logs will be uploaded as-is. The size of storage deal is depend on the user and may be vay (from 2 MiB till 2 TiB). In general the index is table that contains log filenames based on timestamp and sequence number.
