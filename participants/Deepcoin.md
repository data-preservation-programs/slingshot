(1) Brief Project Description

    Deepcoin is a global digital asset trading platform with all-inclusive financial services. It was founded in 2018, established in seychelles and headquartered in Singapore. As our name called, in order to provide Deep liquidity, we hold positions on major exchanges around the world and transfer liquidity between them, allowing our users to enjoy good enough trading depth, especially in extreme markets. One of the biggest problems is the risk of delay in transferring time on the chain and the risk of holding positions on various exchanges, particularly Bitcoin. Therefore, we use artificial intelligence algorithms to make some predictions about the price trends of each exchange and the distribution of liquidity across the network

(3) What does your application/UI do?

	We need to collect and store large amounts of data and deploy artificial intelligence analysis. Here are some examples：
	The clustering algorithm is used to analyze the transfer data on the whole chain and construct the transfer map on the chain, such as identifying large accounts which disguised as a large number of retail addresses and analyzing their asset movements. 
	Using the Hidden Markov Model, the price and volume data of the exchange is analyzed to predict the large fluctuation rate and direction change. 
	We also analyze the order book data of each exchange ,and deploy  Reinforcement Learning through a large number of order-making experiments to analyze and identify their market-maker’s strategies and liquidity movements.

(4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

	Data are obtained from many public chains and analyzed and predicted

(5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

	Analyze the whole network of some reliable chain trading information

(6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

    About 100 TB
	
(7) How are you structuring the data?

	Data parsed from different public chains will be structured and saved.
	
(8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

	After the data is obtained, it will be classified and collected by our customized program, and the data with reference value will be extracted and saved

(9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?

	File storage is currently done through Lotus

(10) How will you retrieve the data?

	The data will be extracted by our program and pushed to the customer, or we will provide the user with the data needed to retrieve it

(11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

	Our users are mainly cryptocurrency investors. The data involved in this project will only be available to ourself and may be open to senior market-maker customers of Deepcoin in the future, but not for the time being.

(12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

	Our exchange has been online for 2 years and currently has more than 10,000 active users per day.

(13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

	The cost and security of future data storage.
