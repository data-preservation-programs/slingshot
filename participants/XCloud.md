XCloudStore

***\*(1) Brief Project Description\****

An IPFS cloud storage project, we named it XCloudStore. We are a development team focused on decentralized storage, and this is one of our projects for ipfs.We hope to provide storage services for decentralized cloud storage applications on the IPFS network. The decentralized fragmentation mechanism protects user privacy, provides lower access costs and more friendly services.

***\*(3) What does your application/UI do?\****

*XnMatrix cloud storage products are distributed storage services for content retrieval addressed access based on the IFS protocol. Here your cloud storage bucket space has no capacity cap, no partition management, suitable for CDN data distribution, data processing or big data computing and analysis of data lakes and other scenarios. You can store and retrieve data of any size anywhere. We offer you a variety of object storage types that you can use to match your business needs. *

***\*(4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?\****

Various

***\*(5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.\****

We do not collect any data, we just provide services. In the IPFS network, we guarantee that there is no complete data in our application

***\*(6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?\****

*We now have nearly 500 GB of data, and we plan to upload some cold data to the IPFS network. In the course of use, if the access speed can reach our expectations, we will upload all the data uploaded by the user to the IPFS network. *

***\*(7) How are you structuring the data?\****

We cut the data into pieces and store them on the IPFS network.

***\*(8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?\****

We will use the API you provide to upload files to the IPFS network. If we encounter problems during the development process, we hope you can help us.

***\*(9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?\****

Powergate，Graph DB, API

***\*(10) How will you retrieve the data?\****

The storage and reading of data depends entirely on our user behavior, and is indexed based on the graph database.

***\*(11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?\****

Individual users and enterprise users.

***\*(12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?\****

Yes, the project is running and our users are growing.

***\*(13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?\****

IPFS network bandwidth, access to data and cost are the biggest challenges we face.
