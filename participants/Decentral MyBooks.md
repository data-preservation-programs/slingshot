Filecoin Slack: mybooks@decentral.cc

(1) Brief Project Description
Easy to read or listen to the classics books and stories.

(2) Link to Project UI
Please include a link to your project application or UI.
https://github.com/DecentralTech/myui

(3) What does your application/UI do?
Mybooks has the Free classics books.

Mybooks is an easy to use application to read or listen to the classics books and stories.
You can also upload any ebook in epub, mobi or txt format from your phone.
Mybooks has a personalised categories and tags that help you discover your next read easily. You can also see the top books and popular authors in separate sections.

(4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?
We're using the data uploaded by our users instead of the curated dataset.

(5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.
What sorts of data will you collect?  No, we don't collect any data for now.
Do you own or have exclusive rights to the data you plan to use? No
Is the data license available online? We use only the free data and plan to add a license for it.
Does the data contain any sensitive or illegal information? No

(6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?
Give us as realistic an estimate as you possibly can at this stage. We understand it's impossible to have perfect information before really starting your project!
100T-1000T may be, I guess.

(7) How are you structuring the data?
Is this structured or unstructured data? What data formats, schemas, etc. does this dataset follow?
It's the unstructured data.

(8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data? No, currently no pre-processing.
How will you prepare this data for ingestion into Filecoin?   see above
What size storage deals will you be making?  Depands on the size of data uploaded by user. 
If this is a tabular dataset or directory structure, how will you maintain indices into the data so you can retrieve specific data as needed for your application? We plan to use directory structure in the coming verison and maintained by our app.
This is currently one of the most important steps to being successful with data storage on Filecoin. Feel free to ask for help and/or look at docs for recommendations!


(9) What tech stack will you use to store the data?
We're using Powergate.

(10) How will you retrieve the data?
Share some more information about the data retrieval plans for your application? How often does the data need to be retrieved? What is the size of each individual read? Do you need to retrieve from Filecoin (colder storage) or from an intermediate caching layer, like IPFS? How will your application/UI retrieve the necessary data and expose it/interact with it in the UI?
The index information will be cacheing in the user side, and will retrieval the payload data when user want to open it. We plan to use the IPFS caching layer in the next milestone.

(11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI? 
Who do you anticipate will use your project/dataset? 
Maybe 15~40 years old, boys and girls.

(12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?
Yes, we have.

(13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?
We'd love to know what you're most worried about so we can help as much as possible. Let us know what you anticipate to be the biggest challenges with this project!
Time is the biggest challenges, you know.
