## (3) What does your application/UI do?

In the HarborCloud system. Users can register their own accounts. Store whatever data you want to store. Important data can be stored encrypted. Retrieve relevant data. Infrequently used data can be archived

lotus.import data use aes encryption

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

Data to duplicate management. Currently consider MQL database implementation, terabytes in magnitude

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

lotus

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

The id of the user's corresponding data is found through the database, and then the hot data is retrieved through Lotus's API. Retrieve cold data through filecoin's API
