## (0) Project Name and Team Slack Handles

*IPFS-scholar/hfs-ipfs-scholar*

## (1) Brief Project Description

*Ipfs-scholar is a platform for academic publishing similar to SCI and EI. However, different from SCI, it avoids many tedious processes and enables researchers and students to quickly and freely publish their scientific research achievements. The system USES the cold and hot decentralized distributed storage mode of IPFS+Filecoin to break the status quo of data monopoly by a few giant enterprises, and decentralize the power, realizing the vision of data producer as data owner and beneficiary.*

## (2) Link to Project UI

*http://122.112.251.156:8022/#/.*

## (3) What does your application/UI do?

*Scholars can publish their research results through IPFs-Scholar, and they can also download some papers and data sets from websites and reward the authors.*

## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

**

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

*All the data we collect is open source and free, and all uploaded data are public data.*

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

*About 1 T*

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

*Most of what IPFS-Scholar stores are papers. The plan is to use hot and cold storage via Powergate.*

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

*In order to give users a better experience, IPFS-Scholar will store some user information and chained indexes, and users will submit files through distributed storage.*

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

*Powergate.*

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

*When users upload files, they are required to provide the summary and other information of the files. IPFs-scholar creates the index of the files according to these information. Our current plan is the off chain index. In the future, we may study how to optimize the index through DHT.*

## (11) Who is the intended user for your application/UI?

*scholar*

## (12) Do you have any users already or plans to acquire users soon?

*Yes, we do. At the beginning, we plan to promote through some internet promotion platforms, and then the team may take out some fils as upload rewards.*

## (13) What challenges do you anticipate with this project?

*I think the biggest challenge for this project is the initial user activity.*
