# Curated Datasets for the Slingshot Competition
Slingshot’s aim for using curated datasets is to ensure meaningful data is stored and retrieved from the Filecoin Network.  The use-cases don’t need to be complex and can be proprietary in nature for applications.

There are a wide variety of public data sets that can be leveraged for this challenge - a sampling is shown in the table below.  

If you would like to use a dataset that you don't see listed here, please submit an issue to add the dataset to this table. In order to qualify for Slingshot,  a dataset should generally be a public good dataset, be accessible to everyone, and not require any special permissions to access. If you are using your own data that you are willing to make public but does not have a source URL, then please share a link to download it in the Link to Dataset field.

## Current qualifying datasets

In an effort to continue diversifying the data being onboarded onto the network, the list of qualifying datasets changes over time as participating teams onboard more data onto the network! Datasets that qualified in previous phases of Slingshot and no longer qualify as listed separately below.
