# Curated Datasets for the Slingshot Competition
Slingshot’s aim for using curated datasets is to ensure meaningful data is stored and retrieved from the Filecoin Network.  The use-cases don’t need to be complex and can be proprietary in nature for applications.

There are a wide variety of public data sets that can be leveraged for this challenge - a sampling is shown in the table below.  

If you would like to use a dataset that you don't see listed here, please submit an issue to add the dataset to this table. If you are using your own data that you are willing to make public but does not have a source URL, then feel free to write 'N/A' in the URL column.
