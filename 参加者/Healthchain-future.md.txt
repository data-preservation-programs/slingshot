## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

- We will give priority to the data in the  [list of curated datasets in this repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/slingshot/blob/master/datasets.md) for some store and retrieval tests, but if it is slow to obtain the data in the datasets due to network reasons, we will consider switching the test source. Of course, we will submit  PR to the datasets.
