## (4) If your project is using a curated dataset, which one are you using?

我们没有使用官方数据集，数据来源于用户授权上传存储。

We didn't use the official data set, data from the user authorization upload store.

## (5) If your project is not using a curated dataset, please tell us a little bit more about your data by answering the questions below.

数据来源于用户授权上传存储。

Data from the user authorization upload store.

## (6) How much data are you planning to store to the Filecoin network during the Slingshot competition?

We have probably 10P data planning store to the Filecoin Network

## (7) How are you structuring the data?

非结构化数据，这些数据可以是文本文件、图片、音视频等。
Unstructured data, these data can be text files, pictures, audio and video, etc. 

## (8) What pre-processing are you doing before ingesting the data?

我们会先将数据上传到IPFS中，然后通过IPFS导入到filecoin中。我们使用mysql来维护目录索引。
We will upload the data to IPFS first, and then import it into filecoin through IPFS. We use mysql to maintain the catalog index.

## (9)  What tech stack will you use to store the data?

Lotus

## (10) How will you retrieve the data?

首先我们会将数据存储到IPFS中，将IPFS中文件的CID保存到Mysql数据库中，然后将IPFS中的数据导入到Filecoin上，当矿工成功达成存储交易后，我们会将Filecoin的CID也保存到Mysql中。IPFS从中起到了写入缓存的作用，同时还作为热数据缓存。
First, we will store the data in IPFS, save the CID of the file in IPFS to the Mysql database, and then import the data in IPFS to Filecoin. When the miner successfully completes the storage transaction, we will also save the CID of Filecoin to Mysql. IPFS serves as a write cache from it and also serves as a hot data cache.
