# IPFS-scholar-
IPFS-scholar is a distributed file storage system similar to the SCI, which provides a free and rapid release platform for scientific research achievements, academic papers and other materials. It also breaks the status quo that data is monopolized by a few giant enterprises, decentralizes the power, and realizes the vision of data producer as the owner and beneficiary of data.
